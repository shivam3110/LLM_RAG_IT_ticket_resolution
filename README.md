# IT ticket resolution AI assistant 

![alt text](rag_lanchain.png)
## Overview
This repository contains a tool designed to assist IT helpdesk agents by leveraging historical data of previously resolved tickets to suggest resolutions for new tickets. The system is built using Streamlit for the UI and integrates advanced AI models for response generation.

## Problem Statement
IT helpdesk agents often encounter repetitive issues that have been resolved previously. However, they lack an efficient way to reference these solutions, leading to inefficiencies and increased resolution times for customer tickets.

## Approach
The solution involves creating an intelligent ticket resolution assistant that:
1. **Indexes Existing Tickets**: Uses embeddings to transform previous tickets into a searchable format stored in a Chroma database.
2. **Queries for Solutions**: When a new ticket arrives, the system queries this database to find similar past tickets and suggests possible solutions.
3. **Leverages Advanced AI Models**: Integrates Meta-Llama, a generative model, to suggest solutions when direct matches are not found in the database.

### Key Components
- **Data Processing**: Consolidates and preprocesses ticket data from various formats into a unified DataFrame.
- **Embedding Utilities**: Employs sentence transformer models to generate embeddings for each ticket, which are then indexed using the Chroma database for quick retrieval.
- **Response Generation**: Implements two modes of operation:
  - Direct response from the database using vector similarity to find and suggest solutions from past tickets.
  - Generative response using the Meta-Llama model to generate insights and solutions based on the context of the query.

## Features
- **Dual Mode Response System**:
  - **Mode 1**: Directly fetches solutions from past resolved tickets.
  - **Mode 2**: Utilizes AI to generate responses for complex issues not directly resolved in past tickets.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit, the UI allows agents to input new tickets and receive instant solution suggestions.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Dependencies include pandas, requests, transformers, chromadb, langchain_community

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivam3110/LLM_RAG_IT_ticket_resolution.git
cd LLM_RAG_IT_ticket_resolution
sh setup.sh
```

### Configuration
Set up necessary configurations in `config.py`, replacing `Your_huggingface_token` with your actual API token.

## Usage
Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
``` 
Follow the on-screen instructions to process new tickets in either direct query mode or generative response mode.

### Modules
- **Data Processing**: Handles the ingestion and preprocessing of ticket data
- **Embedding Utilities**: Manages the embedding and querying operations using sentence transformers and - Chroma (*see embedding_utils.py*).
- **Response Generation**: Interfaces with the Meta-Llama model to generate responses based on past - ticket data
- **Main**: Orchestrates the overall workflow from data loading to response generation (*see app.py*).

## Shortcomings

- **Data Dependency**: The systemâ€™s effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality and volume of the historical data, which can vary.
- **Complex Queries Handling**: The current setup may not handle highly complex or ambiguous queries effectively, especially those that do not closely match any historical tickets.
- **Adaptability**: The system might not adapt quickly to new types of tickets that have not yet been documented extensively.
- **Evaluation**: Response quality metrics and user satisfaction

### Proposed Solutions: 

- **Improve Data Collection**: create a large database of old tickets
- **Fine tune LLM**: on a dataset specific to IT support can significantly improve their ability to handle complex queries.
- **Continuous Learning**: Incorporate mechanisms for the system to learn from new tickets and user corrections.
- **Statistical scores & LLM based metrics**: Evaluate effectiveness


## Future Directions

- **Enhanced AI Models**: Explore more advanced LLMs that could provide more accurate embeddings and generative responses.
- **Feedback Loop**: Implement a continuous learning system where the model adapts and improves based on new tickets and agent feedback.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Work on APIs or plugins that allow easy integration with a variety of existing helpdesk software.
